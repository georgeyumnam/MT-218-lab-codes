# This is the solution to the homework - 3 problem

##  The stated problem:
### Take the olympic logo and analyse the area of the circles. Report the area of the intersection of three circles, two circles and the area without any intersections.

## Results after compilation of the code:
### Consdering that the circles in the Olympics logo have a radius = sqrt(3) m 
### Then the following is the area of the sections:::--->>
###
### 1) Area of circle............... = 2.8274e+01
### 2) Area of 3 junction........... = 2.9896e+00
### 3) Area of 2 junction........... = 8.7766e+00
### 4) Area of no intersection...... = 2.0616e+01
