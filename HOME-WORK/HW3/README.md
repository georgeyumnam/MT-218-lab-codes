# This is the solution to the homework - 3 problem

##  The stated problem:
### Take the olympic logo and analyse the area of the circles. Report the area of the intersection of three circles, two circles and the area without any intersections.

## Results after compilation of the code:
### Consdering that the circles in the Olympics logo have a radius = 0.9 m 
### Also, in order to preserve the geometry of the Olympic logo,
### we have taken the circles with centers::
### (-2,1) - blue
### ( 0,1) - black
### ( 2,1) - red
### (-1,0) - yellow
### ( 1,0) - red
###
### Then the following is the area of the sections:::--->>
###
### Area of one circle.......................... = 3.0172e+00
### Area of 3 junction.......................... = 0.0000e+00
### Area of 2 junction.......................... = 2.0364e+00
### Area of no intersection..................... = 1.1008e+01
### 
### Total area (ANALYTIC) with double counting.. = 1.5086e+01
### Total area (COMPUTED) with double counting.. = 1.5085e+01
### 
###
