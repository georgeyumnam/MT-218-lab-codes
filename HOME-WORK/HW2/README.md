# Home-work - 2 :apple:

This is the guidelines towards this homework.

## Task 
To modify the in-class code and set a biased direction of our choice.

Perform this for a case with a line seed.

## Files description

### dla 
Executable file generated after compiling the home-work code : random_walker_DLA-new.c

### fig0.png
The image to the modified code from in-class code - initialized with a seed in the center of the grid.
[Just for comparison with the case of the task assigned]

### fig1.png
Top view of the nucleation growth under biased conditions (biased along the positive x direction)

### fig2.png and fig3.png
Side views of fig1.png

### random_walker_DLA.c
The pristine file without modification -- not for submission -- just included to compare with the homeowrk file.

### random_walker_DLA-new.c 
The HOME-WORK code (This is the code which generated - fig1, fig2, fig3)
This takes care of the biasing of the nucleation growth direction.

### solid.dat
The data file generated from the code.
